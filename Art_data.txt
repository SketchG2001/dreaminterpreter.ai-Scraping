User Input: 1: I was in my bedroom, which was empty. On the east wall of my bedroom the baseboards were lifted up about 2 feet. This 2 foot gap allowed me to see into the room next to it, but it wasn't a familiar room. It had yellow lighting coming from several lights, but most recognizable was a chandelier. The walls in this room were a dark blue. There was a man in the room I knew I recognized, but in reality I didn't. I think in the dream I may have been in love with him. He was 5'8 with short brown hair, and I can't remember the face. I later figured out he was a serial killer, and at one point was trying to get him out of my house. I kept fighting to close the front door to keep him outside, eventually I was able to close and lock it. After several minutes I opened to check if he was still there, and he was. He was on the side of the house seeming to wait for me to open the door. Later I was with my family at a store, and we seemed to be trying to run away from the serial killer. The store had a completely different layout than normal. I later suggested that my parents should leave me in the store. After they left the store anf got in the car I seemed upset that they were actually going to drive away. I ran outside to the car and started talking to them from outside the car, while they were inside. After talking for a while I left them alone.

Interpreter Response: 1: In this dream, the empty bedroom represents a sense of emptiness or emotional detachment in your life. The lifted baseboards and the view into the unfamiliar room symbolize an opportunity for you to gain insight into unknown aspects of yourself or explore new possibilities. The yellow lighting and chandelier in the room next door suggest a sense of warmth and allure, potentially representing your desires or passions.

The man you recognize but don't truly know could symbolize an aspect of your own personality or potential romantic interest that you are currently unfamiliar with. Your belief that you were in love with him in the dream may indicate a longing for a connection or a desire for romance.

The revelation that he is a serial killer suggests a hidden danger or threat in your life, perhaps representing fears or anxieties that you are trying to keep at bay. Your struggle to close the front door to keep him out of your house reflects your efforts to protect yourself from this perceived threat.

The store with a different layout symbolizes a sense of disorientation or uncertainty in your waking life. Your desire for your parents to leave you in the store can represent a desire for independence or a need to confront your fears on your own. However, when they start to drive away, you feel upset because deep down, you still want their support or guidance.

Ultimately, the dream may reflect your subconscious exploration of different aspects of yourself, your desires, and your fears. It could be a call to reassess your current situation, confront your anxieties, and seek support from those you trust.

User Input: 2: I was with my family. My room was different, the baseboards were lifted up on one wall, and I could see into another room because of this. The other room had dark blue walls and yellow lighting from a chandelier, and tons of other lighting, but the chandelier and blue walls were the most noticeable. A serial killer was after me, he was about 5'8 with short brown hair, I couldn't really see the face. At one point we went to a store, but the layout was different that normal. I was left behind in this store because I told my parents to.

Interpreter Response: 2: Based on the details provided, this dream may symbolize feelings of vulnerability and fear within your family dynamic. The different layout of your room with lifted baseboards could represent hidden aspects or changing dynamics in your family. The dark blue walls and yellow lighting from the chandelier may indicate a sense of unease or discomfort in your home environment.

The presence of a serial killer suggests that you may be experiencing a perceived threat or danger in your waking life. The fact that you couldn't clearly see the face of the killer may suggest an unknowable or elusive source of fear. This could symbolize a fear of someone or something that you are unable to identify or understand fully.

The altered layout of the store could represent unfamiliarity or a sense of being lost in your current circumstances. Being left behind in the store after requesting to stay may reflect a desire for independence or solitude in dealing with your fears.

Overall, this dream may reflect underlying anxieties or concerns within your family and a struggle to navigate or confront these issues. It may be beneficial to explore these feelings further and consider any potential sources of fear or unease in your waking life.

User Input: 8: I was walking into Mrs Patterson's class and i see raymone and Lorenzo hanging out in the back. Lilly is there with millie and Amelia. Lilly has on purple eye shadow and is wearing a black vest jacket. Mille is wearing a dress with white and blue flowers and Amelia is wearing the same green dress she wore at Ethan's party. Amelia goes to Mrs. Patterson and she shows her a poster she made. It was innthe shale of a pentagon and it was purple. I could over hear them saying the words "handsome" and "young man". Amelia comes and sits next to me and she shows me the poster, it was just purple with no words on it. She takes out a bag with the word "prom" on it and hands me a a large lilly pad with a white and yellow flower in the middle. I said "oh my gosh thank you so much". She said, "I didn't expect you to be this happy, have you never gotten flowers before?". I look over at lilly and shew giving me the meanest side eye ever. Music starts playing out of nowhere and everyone leaves the class. Now we are somewhere in a venue and everyone is wearing green. I was the only one not wearing green. I had on a white shirt and white pants with a black jacket over it. Lorenzo calls me over and we start dancing. I look over at where Amelia was and lilly was still mean mugging me. I leave cause I felt uncomfortable trying to find green clothes to match with everyone. I couldn't find any and I went to the table where I left the flower Amelia gave me. It had the same smell of lilly on dec 16 and the petals felt just like her soft skin. I was pulled out of the room by 2 people in all black. They looked like teenagers. I dont remember much of the conversation but suddenly sexyy red started to play on the speakers. We all ran back to the venue to start dancing and I get caught on a fence. When u got out I fell into a bush and everything was green. When I made it back the song was over and a white song started to play. Nobody was dancing except for the girls. I walk over to Lorenzo and tell him that I couldn't find anything green to wear. He told me to "look over there" and pointed at lilly, she was still staring at me and not dancing while her friends were. She walks up to me to say something and I couldn't hear anything she said. All I was focused on were her brown eyes but I could feel her words touch my lips. Then I woke up cause I needed to pee.

Interpreter Response: 8: This dream seems to reflect your feelings of insecurity, longing for acceptance, and a desire for connection with others. Mrs. Patterson's class represents a familiar and safe space for you. Raymone, Lorenzo, Lilly, Millie, and Amelia may symbolize different social dynamics and relationships in your waking life.

Lilly's purple eyeshadow and black vest jacket could indicate a sense of confidence and individuality, while Millie's dress with white and blue flowers symbolizes sweetness and innocence. Amelia wearing the same dress as she did at Ethan's party suggests a familiarity or comfort with her presence.

Amelia showing Mrs. Patterson a purple pentagon-shaped poster may represent her desire for recognition and approval. The overheard conversation about a "handsome" and "young man" may indicate your longing for validation and acceptance from others, particularly Amelia.

Amelia sitting next to you and showing you a blank purple poster could suggest that she sees potential and creativity in you, even if you may not fully see it in yourself. Her giving you a lily pad with a white and yellow flower symbolizes an offering of friendship or affection, which you deeply appreciate.

Lilly's mean side-eye and discomfort when you express happiness may reflect feelings of jealousy or insecurity on her part. This could be related to your sense of not fitting in or not having green clothes to match with everyone else. The venue and everyone wearing green may represent a social environment where you feel out of place and anxious about meeting expectations.

Being pulled out of the room by two people in black could represent internal or external pressures that remove you from a situation where you do not feel comfortable. The conversation and the song "Sexy Red" may symbolize a flirtatious or slightly rebellious aspect of yourself that is eager to be expressed.

Getting caught on a fence and falling into a green bush could symbolize obstacles or setbacks in your pursuit of connection and acceptance. The girls dancing while the white song plays may represent a sense of exclusion or feeling like an outsider in certain social situations.

Lastly, Lilly approaching you and attempting to communicate, but you being unable to hear her words, may suggest a feeling of being misunderstood or difficulty in decoding her true intentions. Focusing on her brown eyes and feeling her words touch your lips suggests a deep fascination or attraction towards her.

Overall, this dream may reflect your unconscious desires for acceptance, connection, and validation from others, as well as the internal struggles and feelings of being different or out of place. It could be helpful to reflect on these themes in your waking life and consider ways to address or embrace your true self without relying too heavily on external validation.

1. Symbolic Transformation: The dream may symbolize a significant transformation or change that is happening or is about to occur in your life.
