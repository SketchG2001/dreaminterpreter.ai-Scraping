In the dream, he leaves and finds you because he feels needy and unable to handle the situation on his own. This could indicate a fear of being overwhelmed by someone's emotional dependency or clinginess, causing you to consider breaking up with him.

Overall, this dream may symbolize your inner conflict regarding the balance between independence and emotional support in a relationship. It could reflect your desire for a partner who is more self-reliant and less dependent on you.
