I get out of my car and open the door, squeezing through into a dark place.  I'm in the closet of my childhood bedroom.  It's a bit snug, and I find myself sitting on the inclined wood that overlays the main stairwell.  I open the closet door and I see that the bedroom has been remodeled.  I clearly don't live here anymore.  The carpet, orange when I was a child was now red, and the large bed in the center of the room had a red and white floral design.  Nothing looked familiar.  Suddenly the new resident of the home walked into the room.  I was embarrassed to be seen and tried to back into the closet.  The man asked what I was doing there and I told him that I used to live in this house and that this room was my bedroom.  I then asked him if I could come inside and see the rest of the house.  He said no, the rest of his family would be home soon and there wasn't enough time." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/8575d7de-8b1e-4960-9da6-831fa3a3c2b8.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154601Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=9feb106366cd1fabc557c5bd202d5245c4a080c4e11dfb23c19bd168c3d22f7b"/>

           <img alt="Dreamt my brother and ex were sleeping around behind my back, getting in a relationship, and everyone was in on it. I kept beating thr shit out of him and he kept mocking me. He and her would always sleep in some room she hadn't let me on (which doesn't exist in waking life).

The police and various people showed up on my front porch, and one of my brother's old friends parents started berating me for having a problem with Calvin. The police were initially pretty concerned, but calmed down quickly. One even broke the tension and got me to laugh by pulling two sides of a fake mustache off. 

My old friend's attractive wife came over and started flirting pretty sexually with me. Right away, I assumed my mom and dad had hired her to get my head off of my ex. It turns out her and her husband had separated, to which I said, &quot;I guess I've been out of the loop a while.&quot; She was very enticing. My sister came up to me shortly after this and offered to kill my brother in secret and we planned quite a bit. 

Between the porch scene and the seeing my friend's ex wife, there was a random side bit where my mom and I went through some labryinth like the one in True Detective Season 1. Once we got through, we arrived at some poor, slightly hillbilly-seeming home. They were asking if we knew where any convenience stores were open. It was after midnight, and nothing around us is open after midnight. They were going to drive 4 hours north to some place to go ASAP. I told them to try walmart and St. Cloud instead. St. Cloud is only about an hour away and should have something open. After they took my suggestion, they brought me home. 

- when my brother was mocking me, he was wearing the creepy white faced mask from Twin Peaks and skipping down the road. He was laughing maniacally and kept giving me the throat slit sign. 

- one of the cops looked like Tommy Lee Jones.

- the hillbilly's house looked like mine.

- when the events started we were at my ex's &quot;house&quot; (she doesn't have a house, but it looked like a friend of mine's). She had a room where my friend's was, and her &quot;secret room&quot; was across the hall from that room. 

- the only friend I remember clearly being with my brother was his best friend

- my buddy's ex came in the back door of my house. The rest took place on the front porch or in the living room, and everyone else came in the front. She also had fishnets on

- at some point I believe I killed my brother." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2fca8d1f-d394-48ed-a7b1-812c36dc36bc.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154601Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=33040542b38d7f5c75c921816d8b630e416aa764fb8e94080a437d8f02ea21af"/>

When I woke up, I was in the middle of a race or monitoring on top of a giant, steel, silver submarine that I was riding on foot. I think The Arm from Twin Peaks was riding the submarine with me and was pissed off that I was messing with him. 

Right before that, I was at some dystopian dunk contest with everybody. I specifically remember Aaron from Alexandria, a very past friend and sort of bully was there. 

After the dunk contest but before the submarine, I went to a house party. I remember Natalie, this beautiful girl, bring at the party and thinking she looked incredibly hot and thicc. Bre, Paul, and Rachel all showed up at the same time as well. I wondered if they all showed up together, but I figured that wasn't the case. Also, the party was at the BM, the place we partied in college, and we came from the dunk contest. My brother was in the dream quite a bit too.

At some point, this part of the dream ended. After this, I was with my brother and a client who is rather odd. We were walking up a snowy road in Buffalo, Minnesota. We talked about the play and played catch with a football.
At some point, some guy around my brother and I's age Was across some trees and a forest next to the road. Our client thought it would be funny to throw a football through the forest. At the guy. The guy started yelling and cursing, Saying that we need to be more careful. When he came through the forest, he had a wife and kid.
