            A Perilous Pursuit: Zombies, Sacrifice, and Unexpected Allies
           </div>
           <img alt="I had a dream about a zombie apocalypse. I found myself outside, possibly after making a purchase, and witnessed numerous people being devoured. Filled with fear, I sprinted as fast as possible. During my escape, I came across a peculiar sight—a girl who had transformed into a zombie but still retained her human consciousness, refraining from attacking anyone. Although she wasn't particularly significant, she intrigued me. Eventually, I reached my street, which miraculously remained devoid of zombies, allowing me to halt my frantic sprint. For some reason, I decided to venture into my nearby school. Upon entering, I heard someone pleading for help. The details are hazy, but all I recall is that the person eventually succumbed to the zombie virus and nearly harmed me. Just in the nick of time, my mother arrived and saved me, perhaps by eliminating the zombie. However, unbeknownst to us, there was another formidable zombie with extraordinary abilities. My mother and I had to devise a new strategy to escape the perilous situation. The subsequent events escape my memory, except for the vivid image of my mother sacrificing her life to ensure my own escape." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/8e35d08e-32b6-4fc5-bf9f-6f3aadd62c60.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154720Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=e126e9a7090bbc9b1bd7a995ee3ee93241959e6a68b546e77e99c0f11addf963"/>

            The Haunting of the Camping Trip: A Terrifying Encounter with a Lurking Monster
           </div>
           <img alt="In my dream, I found myself camping with three of my cousins. Among them was a girl around my age, who was slightly older, a baby boy, and an older guy who appeared to be around 19-21 years old (although I can't recall his exact age). We were quite close to each other, by the way. The initial days of the camping trip were relaxed and peaceful until the next day arrived. Strangely, we ended up in a bar or club (even though my niece and I were very young in the dream, about 12 years old, so I couldn't understand why we were there). On the left side of the establishment, there was a furniture store. We entered the store to browse something (unfortunately, I can't remember what it was). We spent a few minutes looking at the item but decided not to purchase it. After leaving the store, that particular day concluded. On the fourth day, things took an even stranger turn. I ventured alone and stumbled upon a treehouse. As I climbed up, I caught a glimpse of an old man. The details are hazy, but I believe he warned me about a lurking monster in the woods. That's all I can recall from that day. However, something noteworthy happened during the night. As we packed our belongings, preparing to end our camping trip, we noticed a figure dashing towards us. It resembled a merged form of Kurayami and Sama from The Mimic, both having a black appearance that allowed the monster to blend into the darkness. I can't recall the specifics, but the monster made menacing threats, warning us that it would harm us if we attempted to leave. While the three of us were terrified and huddled on our beds, I'm not certain what happened to the baby. The following day, I woke up exceptionally early, around 5 a.m., and immediately roused my cousins since the monster was no longer in proximity. We hastily took our bags and fled to my nephew's car. He took the wheel, but it suddenly dawned on me that we had forgotten the baby. My nephew exited the car to retrieve the baby (it's worth mentioning that the monster had noticed our escape and was pursuing us, yet my nephew selflessly put himself at risk to save the baby, although he didn't perish). I don't recall whether he managed to return to the car, but I do remember that I ended up driving, despite lacking the knowledge of how to operate a vehicle. After a few minutes, my nephew somehow resumed control of the car (to be honest, I can't remember how he got there). He drove us to a town or a similar location, specifically a soap store, where we unexpectedly encountered our grandma and her friend. I immediately embraced her, although her personality differed slightly from my real-life grandma. My nephew decided to leave both me and my niece at the store since we expressed a desire to stay. We proceeded to explore the store, and I took a seat. Surprisingly, a few seconds later, several elderly men occupied the chairs in front of me and commenced questioning me. And then, I woke up from the dream. It's important to note that I have never been camping before, and the town we visited in the dream didn't resemble the place where my actual grandma resides." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/7a2f1d26-5e79-4767-8165-84160c99fa7c.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154720Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=70169f58f0fcc6f8f4aba787b4d8d5958dc3793eca2f6238a63413ace50b3aff"/>

            The Maze of Monsters: Funneh's FNAF Adventure and Sibling Bonding
           </div>
           <img alt="I had a dream where I embodied my favorite YouTuber, ItsFunneh (just to avoid any confusion). Funneh and her siblings were immersed in playing The Mimic Jealousy's Book: Chapter 3 (note that this chapter hasn't been released yet). They found themselves in a massive square maze room, with a relentless monster hot on their heels. The dream abruptly ended there, only to be followed by another dream. Surprisingly, both dreams seemed intertwined. I continued to experience the dream from Funneh's perspective. Funneh, accompanied by two of her siblings (I can't recall which ones, but there were definitely two), embarked on an entirely different version of FNAF—a three-dimensional game or something of the sort. They ventured into a room stage, where I observed a small circular platform positioned at its center, adorned with four buttons to be pressed. The trio reached the stage, and the round commenced. Although the gameplay resembled FNAF to some extent, there were no cameras involved. Instead, the buttons acted as some kind of weapons that had to be pressed whenever the animatronics came too close. Unfortunately, Funneh's siblings repeatedly met their demise, while Funneh herself valiantly took charge of the situation. Eventually, she conquered the level, allowing the door to the next level to swing open. Without hesitation, Funneh entered (though the other two were still respawning, and by the time they returned, the door had already shut). Notably, the subsequent level carried a theme inspired by FNAF 2. Funneh emerged victorious once again, progressing through the door. Let's fast forward to the final stage, as it followed a similar pattern. The ultimate stage mirrored the themes of Ultimate Custom Night, plunging Funneh into darkness where she had to confront over 50 animatronics. Against all odds, she emerged triumphant, having persevered through the darkness. Subsequently, she found herself teleported back to the starting point, where she encountered all of her siblings (Rainbow, Gold, Lunar, Draco). They decided to replay the game, with Funneh shouldering most of the burden. Nothing particularly captivating occurred during this round—they simply exchanged questions about each other's favorite foods and such." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/8ba225ae-a2af-42d3-a0d0-36817ae8fa21.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154720Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0bc477ddbabcb43acf833f60a336be2d9056f1e1759f64cd08e560a872670a04"/>

            Lunch Box Quest: Betrayal and Retaliation in a Dreamy School Flashback
           </div>
           <img alt="I had a dream where I found myself back in my old school, searching for my ice cream-themed lunch box. It seemed like a flashback since I remembered being in that school. As I looked around, my attention was drawn to a conversation between two of my classmates, both of whom happened to be my friends due to our frequent group collaborations. I approached her and asked about my lunch box, and she directed me to a place with a peculiar giant gear structure in the center (which definitely wasn't in my old school, I promise!). To the right of the gear, there was a multitude of lunch boxes. I checked inside them and, to my relief, found my lunch box among them. Returning to the classroom where my classmates were, I observed the absence of my other classmate, but it didn't concern me much as I assumed she had simply departed for home. I proceeded to engage in another conversation with my classmate, expressing my gratitude, and, inexplicably, asked her if she knew the whereabouts of some other belongings of mine (I can't recall exactly what they were). Once again, she provided the information, and I went to retrieve my belongings from the indicated location (although I can't remember where that was either). I went back to my classmate once more to thank her yet again. Finally, I left the scene, but not before witnessing her recording a video from the window, making false claims about the situation. She stated that I had approached her, falsely claiming that her lunch box was mine, and had the audacity to ask her about my other belongings. I was infuriated by her dishonesty, so I hurried home, contemplating some form of retaliation. Upon reaching home, I found myself in an unfamiliar place, perhaps a bathroom, although it was dimly lit, making it hard to discern. In my misguided attempt to avoid being noticed by my mother, I planned to break through a wall to gain access to my room. While executing this impractical plan, I noticed my cousins and mother watching something outside the window. As I glanced in their direction, I realized that my niece had spotted me and appeared perplexed. Worried that she might inform my mother about my actions, I hastily made my way to my room, hoping to evade their attention. Once inside my room, I settled down on a chair, and that's where the dream abruptly ended. It's worth mentioning that the house depicted in the dream was not the same as my actual house in real life." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/75997705-3ec3-4d74-8e97-eb5b6a9e9eee.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154720Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=96287f2ab68ed5ec08a120f90c9a284882619d59ef272d5cdd8ee3c555011704"/>
