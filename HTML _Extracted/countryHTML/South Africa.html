I know it was a dream cause the room was lit with a dark blue light. I felt I couldn't move and there was a small ringing sound in my ear. I wasn't to bothered at first thinking that I should just go back to sleep, but the ringing started to get louder and I still couldn't move. It felt like I was struggling to breathe like I was suffocating and the ringing became  so loud it was deafening I tried to move and couldn't so I tried to jerk my shoulder to get on my back.

So I jumped in the water and swam to the bottom. The bottom was filled with what looked like glowing blue stones. I started ti dig through the stones until they were no longer blue, but looked burning coal. I thought to myself that I should be careful not to dig to deep or I'll end up in hell and sure enough as I looked up there were to black gates and behind it was hell.

           <img alt="I went to a bar with my mother. Right as we entered the bar I bumped into a stranger. We both apologised and I asked if he wanted to go outside and have a cigarette with me. He agreed and we went out having small talk and a group of his friends joined us. There were males and females. We all started talking and had a good time until everyone's faces just went emotionless and starred in front of them. The all started running in a perfect straight line in the direction they were facing. I distinctly recall how they almost bumped into each other while they were running on their own path. I was asking the guy who I originally bumped it what was going on, and he didn't know either and started running after one of his girlfriends. I followed him until he sunddenly turned around facing me and gave a aggressive deafening scream" class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c10c69c6-e950-4a70-a7c7-84057148242a.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154659Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=544a785e2f568725693e9fb26965c7cbc8a9e9cd4536299649d4a0774d5f7609"/>

All of a sudden a small wave breaks on the side of my boat and splashed me, as soon as it happened to me, it also happened to the man on the TV, because he said so. I thought it was very strange, but then the voices wasn't coming from the TV anymore, but in my head. And it was my voice, but I had no control over it. It started to mock and bully me, and even started to sing a song that was berating me. I soon realised that I knew the words he was going to sing before he sang them. Then I could change the words he was singing. And now I was singing and I was singing the words &quot;this is my voice, I am in control&quot; and then I accented from the boat" class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/3c1c5f08-4b0a-4595-a909-6ad05c8084cb.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154659Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=75f192fb9d815f08967272a65581302c3bdc9aa0fe688a084e5cb769abbfdab4"/>

The man leaned against the door as if waiting for me to do something. So I convinced my self that he should be scared of me and that I am the real danger in this void. I charged at him, repeating the words in my head until a screamed it outloud. Then the man just disappeared and I was alone. Still scares, but I felt scared of myself.

            The Elusive Sheep: A Dream of Genetics, Breeding, and Escaping Trouble
           </div>
           <img alt="There were some two boys of my age who were pulling a Sheep with a rope. The rope was tied on the sheep's neck. This sheep was most beautiful and very huge. It had the best genetics I have ever seen from a sheep. It was male in gender. When the boys were pulling it I really wished to have a female sheep of mine so that I can breed it with this sheep to pass its genetics. But at some point this sheep lended in my hands. I was then the one pulling it instead of those two boys. When I was the one pulling it, I decided to take it to a place with people I know may have sheep's too, and I wanted this sheep to breed with theirs so that the genes can be passed on. Hoping that one day when I have a sheep It will get those genes from the babies of the sheeps I made breed with this sheep with the best genes. Unfortunately I wasn't lucky enough to get sheeps where I went to. One strange thing is that when I was still walking with this sheep pulling it with a rope on its neck, it ran to some yard along the road and there were goats there, it tried to mate or breed with one goat but the attempts failed. Towards the end of my dream, this sheep was now starting to be aggressive with me. It wanted to escape and go to the boys it was initially with. Or to its rightful owners. Its aggressiveness was that of a huge dog. It tried to bit me like a dog, and was attempting to escape the rope and run away. I spent the rest of the time trying to ensure that it doesn't escape. Especially escaping without me finding sheeps it will pass its genes on. My older brother was now with me trying to assist me so that the sheep doesn't escape. In the midst of all that, I noticed a police van from distance, and I happen to know that the police were with the two boys who are the owners of this sheep. They were looking for it if o it was a stolen sheep now. Smelling trouble, all I then wanted was to leave the sheep tied to a huge stone with its rope so that it doesn't run away and the police don't find it with me. At that point the urguement was heated up with my brother. I just saw him not being resourceful in helping me achieve all that. He even got mad me and tried to be physical with me with his aggressiveness. I shamed him because the aggressiveness he showed was the one I wanted him to invest in trying to make sure that the sheep doesn't escape since it was now aggressively trying to escape from my hands." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/b20f8b52-fe4e-469b-87bf-9c5276cce9fb.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154659Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=b4a6f70400eb09633f169e6cabe0d98716f0f92b4dfec32d79cb4bceaa33709a"/>
