I decide to tidy it again and while plugging in a cable into my computer, the cable breaks and it makes weird electrical noises. I am afraid of getting electrocuted.

           <img alt="i was rummaging around in a pile of stuff on the shelf by by front door and found a pouch of lalaloopsies i used to play with when i was little. including one that i had take down to the park in the snow, where i lost one of her lalaloopsy friends. a new reporter told me that they think someone had found my lost lalaloopsy in australia or spain or somewhere like that.
flash forward, me and my family and a random old woman who i don’t know but didn’t question are sat in a car, driving through a very orange, dry landscape. we heard about an epidemic that had begun in spain. the disease could be caught in the plants and shrubbery in the area (some sort of spore or pollen) and the native animals were also carriers. so basically we are in a foreign country during a pandemic and no one could help us. my family are panicking and looking for a solution when suddenly the car encounters a very inconvenient obstacle. an enormous gorilla had begun banging its fist of the windows and doors of our car. my family was screaming and yelling, fearing for their lives when suddenly, the gorilla caught hold of the latch that opened the boot, and before we knew it a gorilla had joined our party. if things couldn’t get any worse, the gorilla had been followed by a solitary coyote who leaped onto our boot. through the shouting and confusion we noticed that the animals were actually quite friendly and allowed us to pet them. but nonetheless, they were potential carriers of a deadly disease and they had to be evacuated. so i grabbed the coyote and threw it out of my car window, shortly followed by the gorilla, who was strikingly smaller and lighter that anticipated. we moved on and after hours of looking for solutions, my family came across a woman who was clearly knowledgeable about this area (some sort of guide) who told us we should be fine as long as we avoid the bushes and wildlife. do you know what the strange old woman did? she waddled into the bushes while no one was looking, as did my dog. i chased after my dog as i don’t want him to die and threw him up to my dad. my dad pulled me up but harshly threw me on the floor and scolded me for disobeying the guide. he apologised and said he was stressed out afterwards and i forgave him. as the family were approaching the car again, i spotted the old lady who had returned. i asked her if she was okay and she responded “i’m good thank you dearie, but i think a coyote bit me” as she revealed a nasty bite mark on her arm. i alerted my mum but subsequently woke up." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/99b77018-5372-4892-a721-b5e8c64747f0.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154608Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=0a232e58a676110d1e91edbfc1d6c0f92a5306ddac86e5fe6448ef72a1c3aea3"/>

            Incessant Fear: Breaking Locks, Hidden Faces
           </div>
           <img alt="When I was a kid, I often had the same dream about our flat's entrance door left open. Every time in my dream, once I had realised it, I became dreadfully scared of someone bad entering our home. I ran to the door and when I was trying to close it, something was wrong with the lock: one time it was simply broken, another time it was actually a door handle that came out of the door once I pulled it. And these dream often involved someone standing behind the door (I could see them in the peephole), so I had to try to lock the door without letting them know of my presence. In most cases I failed, and the person on the other side of the door pulled it, I became terrified, and the dream ended.
What is the meaning of this dream?

            Coven Chronicles: Unveiling Prophecies and Unintended Ascension
           </div>
           <img alt="I was part of a vampire coven in my hometown.  We weren't big or powerful, but we were family, and we didn’t usually feed on human blood but used animal blood instead, mostly livestock.  There was me, another older woman called Annie, and a man called Tony who was our leader.  We all lived together in a cosy set of rooms hollowed out from caves under the town hall.  There was a hidden entrance to our caves in the old prisoner's cells in the basement of the town hall.
A few years after I became a vampire, we found a new vampire called Matt who had been experimenting with what his powers could do, but Tony asked him to slow down with trying things out when he came to live with our coven, to make sure he wouldn't get into any danger.  He complied but wasn't happy about it.
We went to a few town meetings about various unimportant things, and after a few months, we met another vampire called Anthony there.  He was very confident and we weren't sure how long he'd been a vampire or where he'd come from, but he was happy to join our coven and had a grasp of basic things he could do as a vampire.
When Anthony joined the coven, he started to suggest that we should be exercising our powers more to keep our human town in check, and he thought we should feed on the humans more, which would make us stronger.  His suggestions started subtle and got progressively more obvious, but Tony turned down only some of them, such as the ones that said humans were lesser than vampires.  Throughout this, Matt was increasingly more upset and anti-social, because Tony was listening to Anthony's ideas but had turned down Matt when he presented similar ideas.
I decided to talk to Tony about the problem since Matt refused to.  I described the problem from different angles and Tony realised what he'd been doing, and said he felt really bad about it.  He mentioned a prophecy detailing how vampires could take their place among humans in the open and suggested that Matt could be the one to fulfil the prophecy.  Tony went to fetch Matt so we could discuss it.
While he was gone, my mind wandered and I started to look around the room a bit, and I climbed the rough-hewn walls of the room, trying to get comfortable.  I found a spot about halfway up the wall and settled into a nook, sitting upside down.  Tony and Matt returned and looked up at me with shock, wondering how I'd gotten up there.  I explained that it was no hassle really, the walls were pretty easy to climb.  Tony pointed out that he had carefully sanded the walls down to be smooth.  I took a closer look and realised the walls were very smooth, but I had climbed them anyway.  Tony listed this, among some other vampiric stuff I'd only seen myself do, and realised that I must be the person in the prophecy, not Matt.  He asked me how I became a vampire.
I had a flashback to going deep-sea diving with someone else who I didn't know well.  I think we had become friends while on holiday.  There was a problem with my equipment and I was about to run out of air, but we were too far down to surface in time.  My diving partner said there was a way to stop me from dying, and asked if I trusted her.  I said yes, and she had bitten my neck before I could react, but I remember this instant feeling of happiness.  I woke up just after she bit me." class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/dc85fa10-a5dc-4ec3-a497-246ed8139d69.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240421T154608Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=66196d967f470c0f26f858e9bee42c25c465da26088b9915bcdcdb8782707b29"/>
