          Inception refers to a dream category characterized by the experience of dreaming within a dream. In these dreams, the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming, only to later realize they are in yet another dream. This recursive and layered nature of dreams within dreams is often invoked in the context of mystical experiences, science fiction, or psychological thrillers.

The inception dream often presents itself as a mind-bending and perplexing phenomenon, as the dreamer may struggle to discern the boundaries between the various dream levels. At times, the dreamer might feel trapped in an infinite loop of dreaming, unable to awaken to reality. The dream may feature a constant shift between different dream landscapes, each with its own distinct symbolism and imagery.

Symbolically, an inception dream can reflect deep introspection, introspective thoughts, or a subconscious desire to explore hidden aspects of the self. It may serve as a metaphor for layers of the psyche that are awaiting discovery or unresolved emotions that linger beneath the surface.
