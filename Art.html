Me and him snuck out and went to this museum and I asked him if he wanted to walk with me and he said later because he wanted to see this exhibit first. We talked and I followed him and there was this girl who had orangish brown hair, cocoa butter skin and freckles the same color of her hair with honey brown eyes and dimples. She was beautiful. They were sitting next to each other on the exhibit that was supposed to resemble a whale and move and spray water but it didn't. She asked me if she knew me before and I asked from where...what school did she go to. I didn't remember her but she said she went to a middle school I never went to. I told her I went to 13 different schools in my lifetime and I started to list them all while struggling to remember a little bit only getting to the third school before Izzy interrupted, leaned over and asked her &quot;Babe did you want to take a walk&quot; and she said yeah and they walked off together while I followed behind.

But I was looking thru all these weird videos he posted of us that I didn’t remember doing, like being in weird park at night that had an elevator with blue neon signs. 

And then dream scene switch. I was in a car with my boss and it was like snowing or something but not snowing but the threat of snow or weather danger was THERE and then an animal ran into the road and I was like “omg a coyote” and she swerved to not hit it and then I was like “wait it’s wearing a collar; it’s a dog” and then I saw actual coyotes chasing it so my boss stopped and we got the dog to jump in the car and that’s when the dog became a horse. A weird blonde dog sized horse. I was petting the horse’s horse nose and it was just blinking at me like “hello I am a horse in the back seat of this car what am I doing here?” And then we were pulling into a garage that was like a J-shaped tunnel and a snow plow came in after us and the guy was telling us something about danger.

And then suddenly I was in my bathroom and my husband was there but he had a full long beard again and he was wearing a black turtleneck and white overalls and he was standing in a bucket holding a paint roller and that’s when I woke up. 😂😂😂" class="Art_image__8A1Kc" src="https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/4698731a-744b-47ea-acf7-7c963e2f7a8e.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240420%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20240420T120136Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=aa11aa0fb224ce9d23a36d37aa3b01158a8dfb5b22d0846cdbb80554640b04de"/>

I was running up to a building trying to avoid a bile titan, Basically a really big scary looking bug, and I got to the top of the building and was above the bile titan, and I pulled out a grenade launcher pistol and shot the bile titan. Contrary to what happens in the actual game, the grenade hit and poofed out a blue smoke instead of just exploding, and I pulled out an assault rifle, A liberator penetrator, and shot the blue gas. This caused the blue gas to erupt in flames on the bile titan.
